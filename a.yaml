## 🧠 Model Training & Evaluation

| Model              | Accuracy | ROC-AUC | F1-Score |
|-------------------|----------|---------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 80.3%  | 0.84    | 0.76     |
| Random Forest       | 83.4%  | 0.87    | 0.79     |
| XGBoost (Tuned)     | ✅ 85.1%  | ✅ 0.89    | ✅ 0.81     |

✅ Best performance achieved using tuned XGBoost with GridSearchCV and SMOTE for imbalance handling.

## 💬 Explainability – SHAP Analysis

- Top Features: `Contract`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TechSupport`, `Tenure`
- Used SHAP summary and dependence plots to understand feature influence.

---

## 💡 Business Insights

- Customers with month-to-month contracts and high monthly charges are 3x more likely to churn.
- Recommending long-term contracts and offering tech support bundles could reduce churn.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add a Streamlit dashboard for real-time churn prediction
- Test TabTransformer for deep learning on tabular data
- Perform time-series churn prediction on temporal user behavior
